### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
**The project aims**

The project aims to learn about Premier League team histories, manager achievements, and player transfers and to explain a little about the second division, which is the EFL Championship. The project also aims to hone the writer's ability to use tools such as Python, Excel, and SQL, especially in retrieving data from the web by scraping methods.

**What is Premier League (PL)?**

The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away. Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures (Wikipedia, 2024).
